02. PascalCase is a naming convention in which the first letter of each word in a compound word is capitalized. Software developers often use PascalCase when writing source code to name functions, classes, and other objects. PascalCase is similar to camelCase, except the first letter in PascalCase is always capitalized.

03. With PascalCase, the first letter of every word in the identifier is upper case. With camelCase, the first letter of the first word in the identifier is lower case, while the first letter of every subsequent word is uppercase.

04. MongoDB is great for transactional stores where performance is a concern. Its also great when the data structure is going to evolve over time, as its schema-less operations allow you to update the data on the fly.
