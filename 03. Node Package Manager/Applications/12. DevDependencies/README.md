// JSHint is a static code analysis tool used in software development for checking if JavaScript source code complies with coding rules. JSHint was created in 2011 by Anton Kovalyov as a fork of the JSLint project. Anton and others felt JSLint was getting "too opinionated", and did not allow enough customization options.
